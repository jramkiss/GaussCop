#' @title Simulation, Inference, and Density Evaluation for the Gaussian Copula Distribution.
#' @description The GaussCop package proposes a simple, unified framework to provide the basic
#' d/p/q/r functions for arbitrary continuous one-dimensional distributions. This can be useful
#' for working with various Copula models, including the Gaussian Copula, for which specific
#' functions are provided.
