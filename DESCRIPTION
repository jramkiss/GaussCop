Description: Provides a representation of a Gaussian Copula distribution to
    efficiently work with arbitrary margins. Fitting of these margins is done
    by kernel smoothing or a combined Box-Cox and Gram-Charlier approximation.
    Functions are also provided for density evaluation and random sampling.
